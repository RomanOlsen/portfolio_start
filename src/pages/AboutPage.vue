          <p>I am a software engineer and what I call a digital builder. I chose digital builder because I have always
            been passionate about making things, and I noticed that I excel especially within the digital worlds. From
            building games using Roblox Studio/Unity/Scratch, 3D modeling in Blender, logo design with Adobe
            Illustrator/GIMP/Canva, video editing, and even building in Minecraft, I've always been curious to explore
            whats out there, and how what I make might solve a problem.</p>
          <p>I'm also an outdoor enthusiast. I love walking along the foothills in my city, Boise. And always down for a
            hike
            wherever I'm traveling. Love running, specifically sprinting. Love the adrenaline rush.
          </p>
          <p>I am a firm believer in both technology and nature and how they can go hand-in-hand. I strongly believe the
            importance of coding hard, and resting hard!</p>
